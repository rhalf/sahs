          Getting appropriate water source for fish and plant cultivation seems
          difficult. Moreover, the agricultural production is decreasing due to
          narrower lands so that land- and water-saving technology combined with
          a variety of vegetable is important to produce maximum yield.
          Aquaponics is a sustainable agriculture system in a symbiotic
          environment by combining aquaculture and hydroponics. This water
          system should flow on the planting medium periodically to ensure the
          plants get the nutrients, while the water can be filtered properly by
          the medium. This research designed a smart aquaponics system that
          could control and monitor the degree of acidity, water level, water
          temperature, and fish feed that were integrated with internet-based
          mobile application. In this system, there was a sensor installed to
          retrieve data, which was then transmitted to Ubuntu IoT Cloud server
          that could be accessed in real time through the internet network.
          Thus, the quality and water circulation were well-preserved. Results
          showed that the success rate of measurement for ultrasonic sensor was
          99.94%, pH sensor of 92.35%, and temperature sensor of 97.91%. The
          temperature and pH water pool that were suitable for aquaponics ranged
          between 20-30Â°C and 7-75 and the monitoring system proceeded as
          expected.

          Aquaponics is a combination of aquaculture (fish farming) and
          hydroponics (plant growing without soil). It is a closed-loop
          recycling fresh water system between fish and plant. Wastes generated
          by the fish become nutrients for the plants after nitrification
          process. The process, which acts as biofilters, cleans the water
          before recirculating it back to the fish tank. Although aquaponics
          can address the issues of food security and sustainability, its
          operation can be challenging because constant monitoring of aquaponics
          facilities for healthy growth of fish and plant is necessary.
